# Experiments with specing clj-xchart.

This is *not* the current/official/blessed clj-xchart. That can be found at https://hypirion.github.io/clj-xchart/.

## Follow the experiments

Eval [these forms](https://github.com/stuarthalloway/clj-xchart/blob/master/examples/xchart.repl), one by one, in a Clojure REPL.

## Random charts cannot be trusted

This chart was randomly generated from a [Clojure spec](https://clojure.org/guides/spec). Vim users are not really implicated in global warming (yet).
